## What is lightride?
Lightride is an open source arduino-based lighting system thought of as a way
to be safer while inline skating or even e-scooting.

## How do I build one? 

You need these things first
- Microcontroller (Arduino, Espressif ESP32 / ESP8266)
- LED Strip (WS2812B supported at the moment)
- (OPTIONAL) 3.3V to 5V logic level converter
- Power source. Can be a Li-ion battery or a stack of batteries
- Skate helmet
- 3 push buttons (left-right turn lights + light controller)

## Hardware design & docs

Any .STL files needed for 3D printing, complete with hooks to put the LED 
strips on will be uploaded via this same repo.
